Solution Plan:

Import URL to get webpage

Import Scanner class to read webpage

instantiate url class with url to be read

get contents of webpage with url.openStream()

instantiate StringBuffer class to hold result (string buffer is a string that can be modified)

iterate through each line in the page

iterate through each word on that page

store each word as a key in a hashtable and the number of times it shows up as a value

Logic for the hashtable : if word exists, add +1 to value field of that word, else, add new word and value of 1. 

sort hashmap based on values with Iterator and TreeMap , show only 20 values
